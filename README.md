# Snapdrop

[Snapdrop](https://snapdrop.net) is inspired by Apple's Airdrop, but is a Progressive Web App built with Polymer and Web RTC.

#### Snapdrop is built with the following awesome technologies:
* [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org)
  * [Polymer Starter Kit](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/polymer-starter-kit/)
  * [Polymer Elements](https://elements.polymer-project.org/browse)
* [WebRTC](http://webrtc.org/)
  * [PeerJS](http://peerjs.com)
* [WebSockets](http://www.websocket.org/) fallback (iDevices don't support WebRTC)
  * [BinaryJs](http://binaryjs.com/)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html)

##### What about the connection? Is it a P2P-connection directly from device to device or is there any third-party-server?
It uses a P2P connection if WebRTC is supported by the browser. (WebRTC needs a Signaling Server, but it is only used to establish a connection and is not involved in the file transfer).

If WebRTC isn’t supported (Safari, IE) it uses a Web Sockets fallback for the file transfer. The server connects the clients with a stream.  


##### What about privacy? Will files be saved on third-party-servers?
None of your files are ever saved on any server. 
Snapdrop doesn't even use cookies or a database. If you are curious have a look [at the Server](https://github.com/capira12/snapdrop/blob/master/server/ws-server.js)
But it does use Google Analytics. 

##### Is SnapDrop a fork of ShareDrop?
No. ShareDrop is built with ember. Snapdrop is built with Polymer. 
I wanted to play around with Progressive Web Apps and then I got the idea to clone Apple’s Airdrop. By doing research on this idea I found and analysed ShareDrop. I liked it and thought about how to improve it.
ShareDrop uses WebRTC only and isn't compatible with Safari Browsers. Snapdrop uses a Websocket fallback and some hacks to make Snapdrop work due to the download restrictions on iDevices.
